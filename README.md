```
Welcome to the comma.ai 2017 Programming Challenge!

Basically, your goal is to predict the speed of a car from a video.

data/train.mp4 is a video of driving containing 20400 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
data/train.txt contains the speed of the car at each frame, one speed on each line.

data/test.mp4 is a different driving video containing 10798 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
Your deliverable is test.txt

We will evaluate your test.txt using mean squared error. <10 is good. <5 is better. <3 is heart.
